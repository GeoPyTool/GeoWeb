# GeoWeb

## A New Beginning

This is designed to be a web version of GeoPyTool. 

But who knows? Maybe it will turn out into something totally different.

Life is not that kind to everybody in recent years.

Hope everything will be better soon.

Though we seem to know that they won't.

## Coding More

Coding is still better way for me to live on than writing articles I think.

Tired of those tiny little groups playing with the funds.

At least I don't need to be a joker or clown to the money holders.

## Pre-Installation

```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
